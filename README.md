# Final group project for QA Academy

# Brief 

Our customer works at an investigation unit. They have access to some data provided by a third-party provider (*name withheld for protection*). 

The provider has gathered information such as call records, financial transactions and ANPR sightings. The data is in a raw CSV format. Our customer needs an interface for exploring this data. 

## Scenario 1: A person has been detained 

A suspect has been detained. Our customer needs to find some background context.  
They only have the suspect’s name and would like to search the data to determine more information about the suspect’s background for example: 

- Biographical Information 
- Associates 
- Financial transactions 
- Whereabouts 

## Scenario 2: An incident has occurred 

The customer is investigating an incident at a particular location. 
They need to find out who was in the area at that  time. 

## Scenario 3: Suspect flees the scene 

A suspect is spotted fleeing the scene of an incident in a car by an officer. 
 The customer has the vehicle's number plate and now need to narrow down suspects using the reported number plate and find out where else they have been.
